# Horiseon Social Solutions Services, Inc.

## Challenge
Refactor an exisiting webpage to make it more accessible and improve SEO.

## Solution
Improved the codebase for long-term sustainability. Ensured that all links are functioning correctly and cleaned up the CSS to make it more efficient by consolidating CSS selectors and properties, organizing them to follow the semantic structure of the HTML elements, and including comments before each element or section of the page.
